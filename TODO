Render athlete names in PerformanceItem when user is admin. 
Render ALL performances when user is admin.
    In order to do this I need to either edit the current 
    useData hook, or create a new hook that is only used 
    when the current user is an admin. The change will be
    a hook that returns ALL performances. If the user is 
    a coach, that list of performances will be fed to the
    performance list. The PerformanceItem will show the
    name of the athlete who had that performance.
