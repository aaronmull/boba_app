Before I continue with the rest of the tutorial, I want to add the athlete linking functionality. Ideally, I figure this out tomorrow (8/14), but 
as long as I get it sorted out by the end of the week we should be good. After that, I can begin designing the home page and using the other
hooks that I've designed and will be designing. I can also ask ChatGPT for help with the design of that athlete linking.
